# BigMap
## Scaling - Fast - Concurrent map for serializeable data

Inspired by [allegro/bigcache](https://github.com/allegro/bigcache/)

## Benchmarks
The benchmarks are done on a machine with an i7-8750H CPU (12x 2.20 - 4GHz), 16GB  RAM (2666 MHz), Windows 10 machine

## Fast access
As you can see, most operations are done in **under 0.3Î¼** and can therefore be accessed over **3 Million times / second**

## Concurrent
The map has **no global lock**.
It is split into **16 Shards** which are locked individual. As the benchmarks show **it doesn't slow down, under concurrent access**

## Scaling
If you have more concurrent accesses, you always increase the shard count.
As always: only benchmarking **your usecase** will reveal the required settings.
