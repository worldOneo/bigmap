## Fast - Scaling - Concurrent map for serializeable data

Inspired by [allegro/bigcache](https://github.com/allegro/bigcache/)

## Fast

Most operations are done in **under 0.3Î¼s** and can therefore be done over **3 Million times / second**.  
And all this **per thread**. This is achieved by storing the objects in one single byte-slice and having a Zero-Allocation, Share-Nothing oriented design.  
Resulting in **minimimal GC pressure**.

## Concurrent

The map has **no global lock**.  
It is split into **multiple shards** which are locked individual.  
As the benchmarks show bigmap **gains from concurrent access**.  
With preallocations and items having a max size it is **faster than the standard map**.

## Scaling

If you have more concurrent accesses, you can always increase the shard count.  
As always: only benchmarking **your usecase** will reveal the optimal settings.  
But as shown, with the default 16 shards, you still get a good access speed even with half a million routines.  
Each shard can store gigabytes of data without loosing performance, so it is good for storing tons of tons of normalized data.

## Comparison with std-lib

| **BigMap** | 2m6s | 0% | 8ms | 0% |
| **StdMap** | 3m31s | +67% | 18.6ms | +132% |
| **Syncmap** | 9m54s | +371% | 18.3ms | +128% |
 
### Async
| | Time | diff |
| --- | --- |--- |
| **BigMap** | 38.1s | 0% |
| **StdMap** (synced with RWMutex) | 4m32s | +456% |
| **Syncmap** | 10m35.6s | +1.568% |

## Attention
The map scales as more data is added but, to enable high performance, doesn't schrink.
To enable the fast accessess free heap is held "hot" to be ready to use.
This means the map might grow once realy big, which might seeme like a memory leak at first glance because it doesn shrink, but then never grows again.
