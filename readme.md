## Fast
As you can see, most operations are done in **under 0.3Î¼s** and can therefore be accessed over **3 Million times / second**.
It also **avoids GC** checks. This is achieved by storing the objects in one byte-slice.

## Concurrent
The map has **no global lock**.
It is split into **16 Shards** which are locked individual. As the benchmarks show **it gains from concurrent access**

As the benchmarks already show, the BigMap gains from concurrency.
As it claims a big chunk of memory and items have a max size it is faster than the standart map.
### Sync
| | Time | diff | GC Pause total | GC Diff |
| --- | --- |--- | --- | --- |
| **BigMap** | 2m1.5s | 0% | 6.6ms | 0% |
| **StdMap** | 3m21s | +66% | 14.7ms | +22% |
| **Syncmap** | 9m46.9s | +383% | 16.6ms | +51% |
 
### Async
| | Time | diff |
| --- | --- |--- |
| **BigMap** | 38.1s | 0% |
| **StdMap** (synced with RWMutex) | 4m32s | +456% |
| **Syncmap** | 10m35.6s | +1.568% |

## Scaling
If you have more concurrent accesses, you always increase the shard count.
As always: only benchmarking **your usecase** will reveal the required settings.
